##### Challenge: Assume that every letter is worth some amount of points based on it's order in the alphabet.
##### If a name's score is determined by multiplying the value of each letter in the name, determine which name has the highest value.

##### A = 1, Z = 26

Example: hello is h * e * l * l * o which ends up being 8 * 5 * 12 * 12 * 15. If you multiply them all together, that's 86400.
